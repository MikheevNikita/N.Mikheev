ThaQuiz project is a basic quiz-like console application with on-line libraries saved in src_lib (listing of existing question sets).
This application reads src_lib, converts it to String type and randomly choses one of existing libraries, then downloads (reads) it, converts lines to Question type and asks user these questions, counts a number of right answers and congratulates regardless of the result.

Features:
– Does not keep libraries
– May have an unlimited number of libraries
– Supports questions with missing part (Something something…)
– Does not depend on number of answers (up to 9)
